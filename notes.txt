// 1-> Any javascrpit function which returns HTML is called a react component
// 2-> File name & Component name should always start with a capital letter only (mandatory)
// 3-> Angular brackets are used to call a component i.e. '< />'
// 4-> The process to call or use a component is called rendering
// Eg. <Student /> calls a component named 'Student'
// 5-> A react component cannot return mutiple tags, so enclose the multiple tags within a single 'div' or 'fragment' tag which will act as a single parent tag & this single parent tag should be returned
// 6-> All tags must be closed (mandatory)

// 7-> component should be made inside src folder
// 8-> 'UseState' is a function that returns two things - (i) variable default value (ii) a function to control variable value Eg. const [count,setCount] = useState(0)
// 9-> All react functions starting with 'use' are hooks
